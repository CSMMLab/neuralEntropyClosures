## Installation

Preliminary: Execute package_installer.sh to install all neccessary python packages. Or use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models

* MK11: ICNN model with sobolev core to train the mapping u to h, alpha (RMSE loss). Uses normalized data. Variable
  network size. Can reconstruct u. Different network call possibilities
* MK12: ResNet model with sobolev core to train the mapping u to h, alpha (RMSE loss). Uses normalized data. Variable
  network size. Can reconstruct u. Different network call possibilities (Not Convex!)
* MK13: ICNN-ResNet model with sobolev core to train the mapping u to h, alpha (RMSE loss). Uses normalized data.
  Variable
  network size. Can reconstruct u. Different network call possibilities
* MK15: ResNet model that directly approximates alpha and reconstructs u and h. Equipped with Monotonicity loss

## Training

To perform an end to end training for a network, call the "callNeuralClosure.py".

Options:

* -a (--alphasampling): Determines sampling strategy
* -b (--batch): Determines batch size
* -c (--curriculum): Determines training curriculum
* -d (--degree): Determines degree of the basis functions (monomials)
* -e (--epoch): Determines number of epochs
* -f (--folder): Determines subfolder of "models"
* -l (--load_model): Determines if programm loads existing model weights
* -m (--model): Choice of model version. It is recommended to use version 11
* -n (--normalized): Determine if training happens on normalized data (recommended)
* -o (--objective): Determines choice of training objective
* -p (--processingmode): Determine to train on CPU or on GPU (if installed)
* -s (--spatialDimension): Determines spatial dimension of closure (1,2 or 3)
* -t (--training): Determine training mode
* -v (--verbosity): Determine output verbosity
* -w (--networkWidth): Determine width of a convex layer
* -x (--networkDepth): Determine depth of the convex block (number of convex hidden layers)

Type  "callNeuralClosure.py --help" for information on the options

## Solver
